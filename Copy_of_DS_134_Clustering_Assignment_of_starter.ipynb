Principal Components are a linear combination of any and all dimensions (features) that will increase their variance, this means that PCs are made up of a mixture of features --mostly the ones with the highest variance, but also smaller parts from other features. This means that they are not comparable to the original features of our $X$ matrix. In cases where we're not reducing dimensionality that much (like the Iris dataset) our Principal Components might be extremely similar to the original features (since there's not that many to pull from) but don't think of them in that way, think of them as a completely new dataset that we can't really apply "
